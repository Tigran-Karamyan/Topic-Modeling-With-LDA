    "* <b>Stem (root) is the part of the word to which you add inflectional (changing/deriving) affixes such as (-ed,-ize, -s,-de,mis)</b>. So stemming a word or sentence may result in words that are not actual words. Stems are created by removing the suffixes or prefixes used with a word.\n",
    "Python <b>nltk</b> provides not only two <b>English</b> stemmers: <b>PorterStemmer</b> and <b>LancasterStemmer</b> but also a lot of <b>non-English</b> stemmers as part of <b>SnowballStemmers</b>, ISRIStemmer, RSLPSStemmer. Python NLTK included SnowballStemmers as a language to create non-English stemmers. One can program one's own language stemmer using snowball.

    "\n",

    "Lemmatization, unlike Stemming, reduces the inflected words properly ensuring that the root word belongs to the language. In Lemmatization root word is called Lemma. A lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata) is the canonical form, dictionary form, or citation form of a set of words.\n",

    "While the tf–idf normalization is often very useful, there might be cases where the binary occurrence markers might offer better features. This can be achieved by using the binary parameter of CountVectorizer. In particular, some estimators such as Bernoulli Naive Bayes explicitly model discrete boolean random variables. Also, very short texts are likely to have noisy tf–idf values while the binary occurrence info is more stable."
